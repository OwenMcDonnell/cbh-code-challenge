#Modify report generation

We want to augment the report PDF that is generated by the `generateReport` function such that it includes the custom_id field added to the database in the previous step. If the custom_id field returned from the DB is `NULL` then the function should revert to using the internal DB id. 
A set of tests should be idenitified within a non-production DB to run this function against.

**Acceptance criteria:**
If the generateReport is called on a list of Shifts which include agents with the custom_id field set in the DB, that field should be included on the generated report. If not, then the field should display the internal DB id. 

**Estimated time:**
2 days (1 to set up testing, and 1 to implement changes to the function)
